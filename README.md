# BugOverflow
Repository made during cuHacking 2019 by team Bug Overflow (Winner of the annual Major League Hacking Cup Stacking Championship)
Created by Wenrui Zhang, Aaron Wu, Cindy Li and Wanda Song
This is a top down game where the player embodies Octocat, the Hero of Git as he slays through the different adversities that the creators of game experienced during the creation process. The goal of this project to instill a sense of catharsis as players get purged from the negative emotions of a incooperative software.
We hope that you will find our first project at our first hackathon intresting and perhaps interesting.

P.S. There is a reason why our team is called Bug Overflow, but don't worry, all of the little things you may find are all "features", product of our driven and engaged development team.
